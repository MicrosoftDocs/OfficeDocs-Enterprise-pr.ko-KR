This checklist will help your organization as you plan and prepare for a migration to Office 365. The phases and steps in the checklist are aligned with the guidance provided by the [Onboarding Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=517115). Feel free to adapt this checklist to your organization's needs.

Most organizations don't need to do anything to prepare for Office 365. It's an application on the web and people are able to use it as soon as they have an account. Other organizations have more locations, security practices, or other requirements that create the need for more planning. For enterprise-level organizations, follow the checklist items below to get started with Office 365.
  
If you want help getting Office 365 set up, [FastTrack](https://fasttrack.microsoft.com/office) is the easiest way to deploy Office 365, you can also sign in and use the [Setup guides for Office 365 services](setup-guides-for-office-365.md).
